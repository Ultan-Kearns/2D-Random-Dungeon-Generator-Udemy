# 2D-Random-Dungeon-Generator-Udemy

This project was created as part of a Udemy course which can be found here: https://www.udemy.com/course/unity-2d-random-dungeon-generator-for-a-roguelike-video-game/.  The course was created by Billy McDaniel to teach participants how to create a 2D random dungeon generator using Unity.  The scripts are written in C# and the assets used are part of the Angband tileset which can be found here: https://rephial.org/.

The bonus section included in the course hasn't been implemented yet but will finish it at a later date.
